    I wake up in the middle of nowhere. No memories, no name. With no idea where I am, there is only one path forward.
    I walks forward cautiously; no idea what terrors or treasures await me in this mysterious place...
    As I step onto the first platform, my legs are enveloped in an ominous white mist.
    
    As I walked into the first room, I was immediately met with a landscape straight out of a fairy tale.
    Was I... dreaming?
    No. It feels too real to be a dream.

    I see a key on the floor; it might be important later, so I pick it up and put it in my pocket.
    I continue my journey forward before I'm face to face with 2 giant slate doors. There was just o-
    ne tiny keyhole.

    I took the key I had found earlier out of my pocket. I put it in and turned the key right.
    A giant click echoed through the room. The ground shook as the doors creaked open.

    I took a step back.

    In front of me was simply... darkness.
    I must be careful.

    Oh! A chest was on my side.
    I opened it.
    There was a weapon..

    It wasn't much but I felt a lot safer with it than without it.
    Especially after I noticed the 2 glowing eyes staring at me in the distance...

    I didn't make any conclusions. After all, this place was still very unknown to me.
    Though, that thought didn't last very long before a growl echoed throught the room.

    It was then that I realised that wherever I am... I was not alone.
